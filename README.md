## Face Network: Analysis of cortical areas involved in human face processing
### Abstract
Face recognition is socially significant and involves highly selective brain regions that are assumed to be organised in a distributed functional network. Many years of research and analyses of brain function have revealed that there is a set of cortical brain regions specialised in face processing (Gobbini & Haxby 2007). The vast majority of research to date is, and has been, oriented towards face-selective brain areas, for example the fusiform gyrus, also known as the fusiform face area (FFA). However, it has been noted that our ability to process facial information involves a much larger number of areas, forming, as it were, a whole network (Face Network). For this thesis, I performed an analysis of fMRI data of the areas involved in processing face information.
